# One Minute Timer

A simple timer that counts down one minute.

#TODO: Should I change it to One Minute Countdown?

## Run It

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
open locahost:8000
```

Then click "Start".

## Development

```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This downloads the latest version of [tock.js](https://github.com/mrchimp/tock).

## TODO

- Install tock.js with something else like npm or bower.
- Flesh out the UI
- Make the timer loop
- Add a 5 second countdown between the one minute timers
